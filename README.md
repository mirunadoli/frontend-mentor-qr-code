### What I learned

While this was an easy project, it was a good practice for centering content in the middle of the page, which was done using the absolute position:

```css
  position:absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
```

Another thing that I practiced with this project was the use of flexbox, for the layout of the component:

```css
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
```

Overall it was a fun little project that helped me get familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS development.
